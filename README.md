# INTRODUCTION
I am a seasoned IT professional with extensive experience in application development, debugging, and modernization, specializing in mainframe programming and enterprise-level solutions. My expertise spans multiple domains, including backend development with COBOL, frontend integration with Java, and database management using PL/SQL and DB2. I excel at creating robust, scalable applications that meet business needs and drive results.
With a deep understanding of IBM System Z architecture, I am skilled in leveraging z/OS operating systems, TSO, ISPF, and SDSF to optimize mainframe operations. I have significant experience in designing, testing, and maintaining applications using tools like Job Control Language (JCL), Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM), and SQL Processor Using File Input (SPUFI).
As a DevOps engineer and architect, I bring expertise in application programming interfaces (APIs), application modernization with CICS, and the implementation of modern development practices. My knowledge of z/OS security (RACF basics) and Linux system administration allows me to ensure secure and efficient IT environments.
I am passionate about application modernization and system optimization, with a proven track record of delivering innovative, high-impact solutions in complex IT landscapes.
